This repository contains Python code for various programming concepts and examples. The main script, `main.py`, demonstrates the application of fundamental programming principles using Python. 

## `main.py`

### Description

`main.py` showcases the following key programming concepts:

- **Comments**: Includes single-line and multi-line comments in Python.
- **Data Types**: Demonstrates usage of Python data types like `None`, integers, strings, and booleans.
- **Variables**: Examples of variable declarations and their scope.
- **Operators**: Basic arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.
- **Functions**: Defines and calls functions.
- **Loops**: Illustrates `for` loops with both iterable sequences and dictionaries.

  addition = 1 + 2
  ```

- **Loops**:
  ```python
  for i in range(1, 10):
      print(i + 1)
  ```

- **String Operations**:
  ```python
  name = "Pratyush"
  print(name.upper())
  ```

- **List Operations**:
  ```python
  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  numbers.append(56)
  ```
